# Realistic Examples for testing

For each, there is JSON and CSV, as well as an SVG file that is the output of the Simple Python Solution.

Examples Currently Available:
+ 50x15 - 50 students, 15 weeks, a seek and find and a discussion each week. Roughly the size of 765 in 2017, however generated randomly. Note that each discussion may have 1-3 "prompted" postings (like those required postings we have in class), that are expected to be longer than the discussion posts.
+ 100x15 - like 50x15, but with 100 students. Good for testing scalability.
+ 765-2015-anon-gb - 60+ students, lots of assignments. An anonymized and scrambled version of this class in 2015. Note that there are some assignments that only have the class had to do. And some assignments that never got graded. Note that this class was graded on a 0-5 scale for assignments. The files ending in "50" have the grades scaled to the 0-50 range.
